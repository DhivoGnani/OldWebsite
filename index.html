					<h2>About myself</h2>
					<div style=" text-align: left;">
					<p>
					I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I initially was studying Nanotechnology Engineering, but had transfered programs after an internship at Vision Critical. I was a full stack developer at Vision Critical, and helped create a reporting tool used by companies to analyze surveying results. I learned how to use various frameworks and tools including .NET (ASP.NET, Entity), and Angular. I enjoyed being a web developer, and was excited in what I could do and create with software. Furthermore, I am in my 2B term (2nd year) at Waterloo. If you wish to hear about my previous school and co-op terms, you can visit my blog.

					In addition, other hobbies I have include reading, playing soccer, swimming, and watching Game of Thrones.
