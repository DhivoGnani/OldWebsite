            ECE 250: Algorithms and Data Structures
            </h3>
            <p>
            This is an important course for anyone who wishes to pursue software. In this course I learned about various algorithms and data structures, which are helpful for developing efficient and reliable software. The material was taught abstractly in a language-independent setting. However, C++ was used for the projects. Hence, I advise anyone, who will be taking this course to familiarize themselve with C++. After taking this course, I developed an appreciation for program design, and what was needed to write effective software.  
            
            <br/><br/>I bought the textbook, Introduction to Algorithms, CLRS for this course. This book is not necessary for the exam, but can be used as good reference material if you wish for a more in-depth derivation or explanation. This book is also known as the Bible of algorithms.
            <br/><br/>In addition, I learned about Asymptotic and Algorithm analysis. Now I am able to look an algorithm and determine its efficiency using spatial and time complexity.
            <br/><br/>
            I recommend that one should be awake in this course because the material taught will be useful for future endeavors including interviews, side-projects, and software dev. in general.

            ECE 240: Electronic Circuits 1
            </h3>
            <p>
            For me, this was one of my tougher courses this semester. In ECE 140, I learned how to solve linear circuits consisting of resitors, capacitors, inductors, voltage sources, and current sources. But in ECE 240, I learned about non-linear circuits. I learned how to analyze and design circuits consisting of op-amps and transistors (MOSFET and BJT). These electronic components behaved differently under various conditions. Hence, resulting in there non-linear I-V equations.
            <br/><br/>The labs for this course were interesting, especially the final one. In the final lab, I got to build an amplifier using resistors, capacitors, and a MOSFET transistor.
            <br/><br/>This course is a lot more challenging than ECE 140, and I recommend those who are going to take this course to do the assignment and example problems in the textbook.
