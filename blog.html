						<h3>
						ECE 250: Algorithms and Data Structures
						</h3>
						<p>
						This is an important course for anyone who wishes to pursue software. In this course I learned about various algorithms and datastructures, which are helpful for developing efficient and reliable software. The material was taught abstractly in a language-independent setting. However, C++ was used for the projects. Hence, I advise anyone, who will be taking this course to familiarize themselve with C++. After taking this course, I developed an appreciation for program design, and what was needed to write effective software.  
						
						<br/><br/>I bought the textbook, Introduction to Algorithms, CLRS for this course. This book is not necessary for the exam, but can be used as good reference material if you wish for a more in-depth derivation or explanation. This book is also known as the Bible of algorithms.
						<br/><br/>In addition, I learned about Asymptotic and Algorithm analysis. Now I am able to look an algorithm and determine its efficiency usig spatial and time complexity.
						<br/><br/>
						I recommend that one should be awake in this course because the material taught will be useful for future endeavors including interviews, side-projects, and software dev. in general. Knowing how to write efficient applications is important, especially for applications that use big data.
